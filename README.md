## Overview
### Description
Weather Wear is a lifestyle app that recommends an outfit to the user based off the weather forecast for that day. Weather Wear also considers what the user has worn recently, the size of their wardrobe, and what colors go together the best.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Our app will first be developed for mobile but will have room to expand to desktop.
- **Story:** Analyzes users clothing choices and the current weather to recommend users fashion and weather appropriate clothing choices,
- **Market:** Any indivudual that wears can use the app.
- **Habit:** Our users should use this app as part of their daily morning routine.
- **Scope:** First we'll start with recommending outfits. In the future we can recommend clothes from online shops that users do not own yet.
